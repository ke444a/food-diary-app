# Calorie Tracking Application "Food Diary"

This is a full-stack web application called "Food Diary" built with React (Vite) on frontend and Django REST framework on backend. The program allows the user to track their daily calorie intake by logging their meals and calculating the total amount of calories consumed. Additionally, the application enables the user to count the amount of protein, carbs, and fats consumed per meal as well as to add meals to the list of favorites for easy logging.
</br>
The frontend sends the requests to the REST API created with Django REST in order to retrieve the information about the user, their logs and favorites. For additional information about meals such as the image of the meal, the backend queries Food Database API. Both the static website and the web server are deployed on Render.
</br>
Moreover, this project makes use of local storage to handle the user's authentication, React Query to send the requests to the API, React Hook Form to handle the forms, and React Router to perform routing. The application is styled using TailwindCSS.
